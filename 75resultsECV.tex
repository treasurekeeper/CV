\subsection{Identifying Prioritization Items with Equal Priority Using ECV (RQ 3).\label{rq3}}

This section presents the results of applying ECV to the industrial and academic CV result data as found through the systematic literature review. Six primary studies included the raw prioritization results in the paper itself or referenced online sources where the data was available. To collect the data from the remaining 34 papers, the author(s) of all papers were contacted.

First, the email addresses provided in the papers were used. If no answer was received authors were searched for using Google, Facebook and Linkedin. Authors from 11 papers provided us with data to be used in the evaluation of ECV. However, due to confidentiality reasons we can not publish this data directly and instead urge interested parties to contact the authors directly.

In short, ECV was applied to 27 CV prioritization cases from 14 studies.
In the cases of HCV, ECV was applied two times to the same data to test both compensated and uncompensated priorities. Equal items were detected in three prioritization cases. A summary of the results of is presented in Table~\ref{tab:ECVresult}.

%rto rephrase the below paragraph. It's completely incoherent at the moment.
In \citep{Svahnberg2008} a prioritization of requirement understandability
criteria is presented. ECV shows that from the viewpoint of academia
researchers, development have the same importance as
product planning (i.e.\ making strategic product planning decisions: release
planning, choosing which requirements to dismiss).

A prioritization of software requirements for an academic course management system is presented in \citep{Berander2009a}. ECV detected that two features---Assignment Submission and Assignment Feedback---have the same priority.

In \citep{Barney2009} software product investments are prioritized with HCV.
The results of ECV was different for uncompensated and compensated HCV results.
When compensated HCV was used ECV detected equal items that belong to different high level prioritization groups ($A$, $B$ and $C$).
Whereas, in case of uncompensated HCV all equal items belong to one high level prioritization group (group $B$).
