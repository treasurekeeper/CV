abstract = {We argue that it is useful to study classes of Multi-Agent System (mas) architectures, corresponding to architectural styles in addition to particular architectures. In this work we focus on a particular abstraction level where mas architectural styles are characterized according to properties, such as, the type of control used (from fully centralized to fully distributed), and the type of coordination used. Different architectural styles support different quality attributes to different extent. When choosing architectural style for a given application domain, we argue that it is important to evaluate the them according to the quality attributes relevant to that application. The architectural style that provides the most appropriate balance between these attributes should then be selected. As a case study we investigate the problem of dynamic and distributed resource allocation and compare six mas architectural styles that can be used to handle this task. We also illustrate the use of the Analytic Hierarchy Process, which is a basic approach to select the most suitable alternative from a number of alternatives evaluated with respect to several criteria, for selecting the architectural style that balance the trade-off between the relevant quality attributes in the best way.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the global localization problem in SLAM: the determination of the vehicle location in a previously mapped environment with no other prior information. We show that, using a grid sampling representation of the configuration space, it is possible to evaluate all vehicle location hypotheses in the environment (up to a certain resolution) with a computational cost that is bilinear: linear both in the number of map features and in the number of sensor measurements. We propose a pairing-driven algorithm that considers only individual measurement-feature pairings and thus, in contrast with current correspondence space algorithms, it avoids searching in the exponential correspondence space. It uses a voting strategy that accumulates evidence for each vehicle location hypothesis, assuring robustness to noise in the sensor measurements and environment models. The general nature of the proposed strategy allows the consideration of different types of features and sensor measurements. Using the popular Victoria Park dataset, we compare its performance with location-driven algorithms where the solution space is usually randomly sampled. We show that the proposed pairing-driven technique is computationally more efficient in proportion to the density of features in the environment.},

annote = {One of the most vexing problems of American federalism is the process by which representatives get elected from the respective states. This paper discusses the muddled precedent on gerrymandering established by the U.S. Supreme Court in Shaw v. Reno and upheld in subsequent cases. After conditionally upholding gerrymandering for political purposes in Davis v. Bandemer, the Court now rejects racial gerrymandering if the resulting districts have a particularly contorted appearance on a map. These rulings lack a clear definition of representation, though the Court has hinted that it may be necessary to move beyond the stark procedural view of one-person, one-vote. Although the concept of substantive representation may seem difficult to apply at first, it may be operationalized by considering the chances that a voter or coalition has of influencing an election. Given the obvious preferences of legislators and parties for “safe seats,” along with this vague Court precedent, voters may be tempted to refer districting controversies to nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions.},

abstract = {Most of the software organizations face difficulties in choosing the measures to collect since there is no universal set of measures for all types of organizations and projects. Experience shows that measurement can be more successful if the measures are collected based on the goals of the organization or the project which it will serve. However, one of the major constraints for the organizations is the associated cost for the resources needed when collecting the measures. Therefore, based on their goals, the software organizations require collecting not only as few measures from a large number of possible measures as possible but an optimum set of measures as well. In this paper, we propose a model, called Optimum Measures Set Decision (OMSD) Model, which is an extension of the well-known Goal Question Metric (GQM) paradigm using a heuristics approach. We performed a survey by distributing a structured questionnaire to a number of people from the industry in order evaluate and get feedback on these factors. We evaluated the rules of the model by means of some sample cases we created. In this paper, we discuss OMSD as well as the empirical studies we conducted in order to develop it.},

abstract = {Voting methods were used by Metsahallitus in a real strategic participatory planning case in a regional working group context. The general aim of the study was to find out whether learning and collaborative decision making could be adequately supported by using the voting methods in the regional stakeholder group. Approval voting (AV) was used to select the evaluation criteria of the alternative strategies, Borda count method and cumulative voting were used to rank the stakeholders' decision criteria and the multi-criteria approval (MA) voting was used to multi-criteria evaluation of the alternatives. Plurality voting was used in public meetings to point out the best plan candidate. In general, the voting methods used were found to be easy to understand and their results transparent, which makes them user-friendly in the participation context. The applied voting methods also promoted learning and decision making in the planning process. Other lessons of the study stresses the key role of the plan alternatives in taking over the planning situation and in learning the trade-offs between different goals. Participants' preference elicitation should not be carried out before the trade-offs have been learned. Furthermore, instead of using criteria averages as approval borders in the MA voting, the approval borders should be specified by the participants of the working group. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we paint a more complete picture of the topic, investigating four prominent multi-winner voting rules. First, we characterize the complexity of manipulation and control in these voting rules under various kinds of formalizations of the manipulator's goal. Second, we extend the results about complexity of control to various well-known types of control. This work enhances our comprehension of which multi-winner voting rules should be employed in various settings.},

By understanding the concepts of credit and credit risk, a quantitative research has been carried out on the credit taking listed company in Anhui province as an example on the premise of considering the availability of data. According to analysis of the company's credit system, combined with of 46 financial statements of listed companies in Anhui Province, 12 indicators are selected for analysis and ranks with the company credit. Then through the cluster analysis of listed companies, these companies will be divided into three types. As results, some conclusions have been drawn from the Empirical Analysis that being work along both effective regulation and institutional innovation is an effective solution to the problem for the way of enhancing the company credit.},

abstract = {Meeting stakeholders requirements and expectations becomes one of the critical aspects on which any software organization in market-driven environment focus on, and pays a lot of efforts and expenses to maximize the satisfaction of their stakeholders. Therefore identifying the software product release contents becomes one of the critical decisions for software product success. Requirements prioritization refers to that activity through which product releases contents that maximize stakeholder satisfaction can be identified. This makes it one of the most important component of software requirement decision support in incremental software development [8]. This paper illustrates the Criteria-Based requirement prioritization approach for software product management. The technique proposed on this paper designed based on the Hierarchical Cumulative Voting (HCV) and Value-Oriented Prioritization (VOP) techniques. The proposed technique, Value-Oriented HCV (VOHCV) can select the best candidate requirements for each release based on the stakeholders input values for each requirement. These values reflect the importance of each requirement in terms of associated anticipated cost, technical risk, relative impact, market-related aspects and perceived value to the stakeholder. The VOHCV inherits the strengths of the HCV and VOP techniques. It also provides a mechanism that takes different stakeholders' aspects into account while selecting the best candidate release requirement, to maximize stakeholders' value and satisfaction [11].},

Under this heuristic, a voter plumps his votes, awarding both to the nearest candidate, if that candidate is much closer to the voter than the second nearest candidate (i.e., if the distance d(v, c 1) <⅟$\beta$d(v, c2) with $\beta$ > 1) or if the second nearest candidate is not much closer to the voter than the third candidate (i.e., if d(v, c2) >⅟$\beta$d(v, c3). Otherwise, the voter splits his votes one apiece for the two nearest candidates. We can prove that two candidates cannot be defeated at equilibrium positions of⅟4 +⅟2/$\beta$2+1 and 3/4 -⅟2/$\beta$2+1 and that the equilibrium state exists if and only if $\beta$ ≥ 1 + √2. Knowing the conditions for and location of the equilibria, we interpret this theoretical model as a dynamical system to prepare for computer simulations to determine whether and when the candidates indeed gravitate towards the equilibrium positions. © Dynamic Publishers, Inc.},

abstract = {Data clustering plays an important role in many disciplines, where there is a need to learn the inherent grouping structure of the data in an unsupervised manner. It is well known that no clustering method can adequately handle all sorts of cluster structures and properties (e.g. shape, size, overlapping, and density). Combining multiple clustering methods is an approach to overcome the deficiency of single algorithms and further enhance their performances. Current approaches to multiple clusterings use ensemble clustering to generate aggregated solution from multiple clusterings or using a hybrid cascaded refinement to enhance the end-result clusters produced by a former clustering algorithm(s). A disadvantage of the cluster ensemble is the highly computational load of combing the clustering results especially for large and high dimensional datasets. A drawback of the hybrid approaches is that, one (or more) of the clustering algorithms stays idle until the previous algorithm(s) finishes its clustering. In this paper we propose a Cooperative Hard-Fuzzy Clustering (CHFC) model based on intermediate cooperation between the hard c-means (KM) and fuzzy c-means (FCM) to produce better clustering solutions. Our experimental results over artificial, real, and text documents datasets show that the quality of the clustering solutions obtained from the CHFC model is better than those obtained from both the KM and the FCM and also better than those obtained from hybrid cascaded models.},

In order to achieve it, we pre-process the ensemble of clusterings to generate its graph representation. We show experimentally that a very small neighborhood will produce similar results if compared with larger choices. This fact alone improves the computational time needed to produce the final consensual clustering. We also present an experimental comparison between our results against other graph based and well known combination clustering methods in order to assess the quality of this approach.},

abstract = {Consensus clustering (also referred to as clustering ensembles) has emerged as a method of improving quality and robustness in clustering by optimally combining the results of different clusterings generated in different ways. In this paper, we propose a new way of arriving at a consensus clustering using a cumulative voting strategy. In our algorithm we use a greedy strategy to select the clusterings in an iterative consensus generation technique that ensures the quality of clustering to be monotonically nondecreasing, In strict sense, the process is not a consensus of 'all' available clusterings and hence we term it as opportunistic consensus. We show empirically that the consensus clustering obtained by our algorithm gives better clustering accuracy than those of all major existing methods for many dalasets.},

In the paper, a new skew detection method of fabric images based on the multi-threshold analysis is proposed: First, Sobel operator gradient is used to extract the weft information, and then improve the algorithm's computational speed by introducing the aberration and more threshold values. To improve the accuracy, false extreme elimination, the mean weight operations and the error compensation are added when using hierarchical Hough transform to detect the skew angle of the weft. Thus, the skew angle of the fabric image is acquired finally. The results show that this method can detect the skew angle of fabric image fast, and the test results are accurate.},

abstract = {Clustering ensembles combine different clustering solutions into a single robust and stable one. Most of existing methods become highly time-consuming when the data size turns to large. In this paper, we study the properties of the defined 'clustering fragment' and put forward a useful proposition. Solid proofs are presented with two widely used goodness measures for clustering ensembles. Finally, a new ensemble framework termed as fragment-based clustering ensembles is proposed. Theoretically, most of existing methods can be improved by adopting this framework. To evaluate the proposed framework, three new methods are introduced by bring three popular clustering ensemble methods into our framework. The experimental results on several public data sets show that the three introduced methods are greatly improved in computational complexity and also achieved better or similar accurate results than the original methods.},

abstract = {Agent technology is a good approach for solving a number of problems concerned with personalized learning. In personal learning contexts individual students are given an environment that takes into account of their needs, interests and aspirations, and this is intended to lead to an enhanced learning experience. The aim of this paper is to show how agent systems can not only form a good framework for distributed e-learning systems, but also how they can be applied in personal learning contexts where the learners are autonomous and independent. We present an e-learning scenario where students try to register for their preferred courses but where courses will only run if enough students register. In this context, we introduce, for the first time, a prototype of an agent-based voting system in e-learning, where autonomous software agents vote on behalf of the students. We present a number of different voting strategies that student agents could use. Finally, through simulation we empirically investigate the resulting satisfaction of the students in the system.},

I took advantage of a natural experiment - a sudden transition from a semiproportional voting rule to single-member districts with plurality voting (SMDP) - to measure the effect of electoral institutions on careerism. My analysis revealed that voting rules have a profound influence on the dynamics of legislative careers: politicians elected under SMDP are far less likely to suffer electoral defeat or to retire than those elected via cumulative voting. The findings of this study not only provide additional insight into the seat safety of politicians elected in first-past-the-post systems, but moreover offer new criteria by which to evaluate the choice of electoral institutions.},

abstract = {We prove that cumulative voting usually enables a minority population to achieve political representation corresponding to apportionment by Webster's method, which minimizes the absolute difference of per capita representation between the minority and the remaining majority population. The minority, of arbitrary size, can generally attain its 'Webster-fair' share of n seats with probability greater than 75 per cent and otherwise, with probability at most 4 n/n+1 1 the minority can attain just one seat less than its Webster-fair representation. Furthermore, for two subpopulations, the potential representation yielded by cumulative voting is identical to that obtained from apportionment by Jefferson's method, and for more than two subpopulations the potential representation by cumulative voting cannot be greater than that of Jefferson apportionment. These results confirm the potential of cumulative voting to yield representation proportional or nearly proportional to population, and the results counter claims or concerns that cumulative voting would be unfairly advantageous to minority populations.

abstract = {Requirements have remained one of the grand challenges in the design of software intensive systems. In this paper we review the main strands of requirements research over the past two decades and identify persistent and new challenges. Based on a field study that involved interviews of over 30 leading IT professionals involved in large and complex software design and implementation initiatives, we review the current state-of-the-art in the practice of design requirements management. We observe significant progress in the deployment of modeling methods, tools, risk-driven design, and user involvement. We note nine emerging themes and challenges in the requirement management arena: 1) business process focus, 2) systems transparency, 3) integration focus, 4) distributed requirements, 5) layered requirements, 6) criticality of information architectures, 7) increased deployment of COTS and software components, 8) design fluidity and 9) interdependent complexity. Several research challenges and new avenues for research are noted in the discovery, specification, and validation of requirements in light of these requirements features.},

abstract = {\{\{$\backslash$textless\}p\{$\backslash$textgreater\}Approval\} voting is a method of voting in which voters can vote for ("approve of") as many candidates as they wish in an election. This article analyzes properties of this method and compares it with other single-ballot nonranked voting systems. Among the theorems proved is that approval voting is the most sincere and most strategyproof of all such voting systems; in addition, it is the only system that ensures the choice of a Condorcet majority candidate if the preferences of voters are dichotomous. Its probable empirical effects would be to (1) increase voter turnout, (2) increase the likelihood of a majority winner in plurality contests and thereby both obviate the need for runoff elections and reinforce the legitimacy of first-ballot outcomes, and (3) help centrist candidates, without at the same time denying voters the opportunity to express their support for more extremist candidates. The latter effect's institutional impact may be to weaken the two-party system yet preserve middle-of-the-road public policies of which most voters approve.},

abstract = {There is very limited research published in the literature that applies content-based image retrieval (CBIR) techniques to retrieval of digitized spine X-ray images using a combination of inter-vertebral disc space and shape profiles. We present a novel technique to retrieve vertebra pairs that exhibit a specified disc space narrowing (DSN) and inter-vertebral disc shape profile. DSN is characterized using spatial and geometrical features between two adjacent vertebrae. Initial retrieval results are clustered and used to construct a voting committee to retrieve vertebra pairs with the highest DSN similarity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is a promising approach for disc space-based spine X-ray image retrieval. The overall retrieval accuracy validated by a radiologist is 82.25\%.},

@article{Nestor2005,
abstract = {Newly privatised firms can often fall between the cracks, being at the same time more risky than SOEs and less profitable/competitive than private firms. A well-designed corporate governance regime is an important tool to make the transition period shorter and less painful. After reviewing the partially or wholly privatised European telecom sector, the paper proposes eight lessons for policy makers in charge of designing privatisation. First, where the State remains an important owner after partial privatisation, it should organise its shareholding function to pursue exclusively shareholder value objectives. Second, any privatisation-related asymmetries between control and cash-flow rights among shareholders should be limited in time and scope. Third, while some minority shareholder power, such as direct shareholder nomination and cumulative voting are welcome, the board needs to develop its own cohesiveness and culture. Fourth, the board should be actively and effectively involved in the development and validation of the company's strategy and the control of major transactions. Fifth, the privatised firms should strive to list in a market with high and credible disclosure requirements. Sixth, privatised firms should focus on developing a disclosure culture, especially as regards non-financial disclosure. Seventh, the board should conduct a regular, thorough and independent evaluation of the CEO, based on a set of criteria and yearly objectives agreed at the beginning of each exercise. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.},

@article{Christou2011,
abstract = {We present a novel optimization-based method for the combination of cluster ensembles for the class of problems with intracluster criteria, such as Minimum-Sum-of-Squares-Clustering (MSSC). We propose a simple and efficient algorithm-called EXAMCE-for this class of problems that is inspired from a Set-Partitioning formulation of the original clustering problem. We prove some theoretical properties of the solutions produced by our algorithm, and in particular that, under general assumptions, though the algorithm recombines solution fragments so as to find the solution of a Set-Covering relaxation of the original formulation, it is guaranteed to find better solutions than the ones in the ensemble. For the MSSC problem in particular, a prototype implementation of our algorithm found a new better solution than the previously best known for 21 of the test instances of the 40-instance TSPLIB benchmark data sets used in, and and found a worse-quality solution than the best known only five times. For other published benchmark data sets where the optimal MSSC solution is known, we match them. The algorithm is particularly effective when the number of clusters is large, in which case it is able to escape the local minima found by K-means type algorithms by recombining the solutions in a Set-Covering context. We also establish the stability of the algorithm with extensive computational experiments, by showing that multiple runs of EXAMCE for the same clustering problem instance produce high-quality solutions whose Adjusted Rand Index is consistently above 0.95. Finally, in experiments utilizing external criteria to compute the validity of clustering, EXAMCE is capable of producing high-quality results that are comparable in quality to those of the best known clustering algorithms.},

So far, the focus of touch points in the early phases has been on the identification of threats and attacks. In this paper we propose a novel method focusing on the end product by prioritizing countermeasures. The method provides an extension to attack trees and a process for identification and prioritization of countermeasures. The approach has been applied on an open-source application and showed that countermeasures could be identified. Furthermore, an analysis of the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the countermeasures could be provided.},

abstract = {Agile requirements engineering is the approach of choice for many software producers whose realities include highly uncertain requirements, use of new development technology, and clients willing to explore the ways in which an evolving product can help their business goals. From customer's perspective, the activity of continuous requirements reprioritization forms the very core of today's agile approaches. However, the freedom for clients to do so does not come for free. This paper presents results of a literature review on agile requirements prioritization methods, derives a conceptual model for understanding the inter-iteration prioritization process in terms of inputs and outcomes, and identifies issues and solutions pertinent to agile prioritization. The latter are derived from the authors' experiences and by using empirical data, published earlier by other authors.},

After controlling for other firm characteristics, we find that firms that have a large, minority blockholder are more likely to allow cumulative voting. We do not find any significant relationship between the use of these corporate governance provisions and foreign ownership. We conclude that the use of cumulative voting is associated with the presence of large, minority shareholders. © 2006.},

abstract = {Cluster ensembles have attracted a lot of research interests in recent years, and their applications continue to expand. Among the various algorithms for cluster ensembles, those based on coassociation matrices are probably the ones studied and used the most because coassociation matrices are easy to understand and implement. However, the main limitation of coassociation matrices as the data structure for combining multiple clusterings is the complexity that is at least quadratic to the number of patterns N. In this paper, we propose CA-tree, which is a dendogram-like hierarchical data structure, to facilitate efficient and scalable cluster ensembles for coassociation-matrix-based algorithms. All the properties of the CA-tree are derived from base cluster labels and do not require the access to the original data features. We then apply a threshold to the CA-tree to obtain a set of nodes, which are then used in place of the original patterns for ensemble-clustering algorithms. The experiments demonstrate that the complexity for coassociation-based cluster ensembles can be reduced to close to linear to N with minimal loss on clustering accuracy.},

Requirements prioritization aims at ranking the requirements so as to trade off user priorities and implementation constraints, such as technical dependencies among requirements and necessarily limited resources allocated to the project. Requirement analysts possess relevant knowledge about the relative importance of requirements. We use an Interactive Genetic Algorithm to produce a requirement ordering which complies with the existing priorities, satisfies the technical constraints and takes into account the relative preferences elicited from the user. On a real case study, we show that this approach improves non interactive optimization, ignoring the elicited preferences, and that it can handle a number of requirements which is otherwise problematic for state of the art techniques.},

abstract = {Clustering techniques organize a collection of objects into cohesive groups called clusters such that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects in different clusters. There are many clustering approaches proposed in the literature with different quality/complexity tradeoffs. Combining multiple clustering is an approach to overcome the deficiency of single algorithms and further enhance their performances. Current approaches to combining multiple clusterings use end-result cooperation (e.g. ensemble clustering and hybrid clustering) between the clustering algorithms. Inherent drawbacks of the end-result cooperation are: the computational complexity of ensemble clustering and the idle wasted time in the hybrid approaches. In this paper, the k-means and the bisecting k-means clustering algorithms are both combined using intermediate-cooperation strategy for the aim of obtaining better clustering solutions than non-cooperative algorithms. Undertaken experimental results show that the quality of the clustering solutions obtained from the cooperative partitional-divisive clustering (CPDC) model is better than those obtained from the non-cooperative algorithms over a number of gene expression datasets.},

abstract = {The decision support methods most often used in timber-harvesting planning are based on a single criterion. In this study, a voting-theory-based method called multicriteria approval (MA) is introduced to the group decision support of timber-harvesting. The use of voting methods alleviates the problems caused by the multitude of decision objectives involved in forestry decision-making and by the poor quality of information concerning both the preferences of decision-makers and the evaluation of decision alternatives with respect to the objectives often faced in practical timber-harvesting planning. In the case study, the tactical forest management plan of a forest holding jointly owned by three people was specified at the operative timber-harvesting level. The task was to find the best actual operative alternatives for the harvesting that had been proposed in the tactical plan. These timber-harvesting alternatives were combinations of treatment, timber-harvesting system and the timing of logging. Forest owners established multiple criteria under which the alternatives were evaluated. Two versions of MA were tested, one of them based on individual decision analyses and other one based on a composite analysis. The first was markedly modified from the original MA, combining properties of MA and Borda count voting. The other was an original MA with the order of importance for criteria estimated either using Borda count or cumulative voting. The results of the tested MA versions produced were very similar to each other. MA was found to be a useful tool for the group decision support of timber-harvesting.},

abstract = {Developing software systems that meet stakeholders' needs and expectations is the ultimate goal of any software provider seeking a competitive edge. To achieve this, you must effectively and accurately manage your stakeholders' system requirements: the features, functions, and attributes they need in their software system. Once you agree on these requirements, you can use them as a focal point for the development process and produce a software system that meets the expectations of both customers and users. However, in real world software development, there are usually more requirements than you can implement given stakeholders' time and resource constraints. Thus, project managers face a dilemma: how do you select a subset of the customers' requirements and still produce a system that meets their needs? The authors developed a cost-value approach for prioritizing requirements and applied it to two commercial projects},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure determination based on the NURBS-Warping method. In this method, the query image represented by the Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) descriptor is warped to best fit the shape of the database image. The similarity between two images is determined by measuring the effort being spent in the warping process. Four similarity parameters are derived to reflect the effort spent throughout the warping process. These parameters are the Total Cumulative Change in the Position of the Control Points (TCCPCP), Total Cumulative Change in the Curvature of the Control Points (TCCCCP), Total Cumulative Voting Distance Score (TCVDS) and degree of matching, which are used to compute the similarity measure for each database image. The retrieved database images are ranked according to the computed similarity measure. A set of experiments is carried out to investigate the characteristic of each similarity parameters that influence the similarity measure computation independently. We also validate the effectiveness of the computed similarity measure for retrieving a set of database images based on the human similarity judgement. The retrieval results of the proposed method are compared with the Curvature Scale Space (CSS) method proposed by Mokhtarian. The overall experiments results show that the similarity measure derived from the NURBS-Warping method show good retrieval results in a highly similar database.},

abstract = {In some areas of the United States, racial and ethnic minorities have been effectively excluded from the democratic process by a variety of means, including electoral laws. In some instances, the Courts have sought to remedy this problem by imposing alternative voting methods, such as cumulative voting. I examine several voting methods with regard to their sensitivity to rent-seeking. Methods which are less sensitive to rent-seeking are preferred because they involve less social waste, and are less likely to be copted by special interest groups. I find that proportional representation methods, rather than semi-proportional ones, such as cumulative voting, are relatively insensitive to rent-seeking efforts, and thus preferable. I also suggest that an even less sensitive method, the proportional lottery, may be appropriate for use within deliberative bodies, where proportional representation is inapplicable and minority vote dilution otherwise remains an intractable problem.

abstract = {This paper proposes a sound identification method for a mobile robot in home and office environment. We propose a simple sound database called Pitch-Cluster-Maps(PCMs) based on Vector Quantization approach. Binarized frequency spectrum is used for PCMs codebook generation. It can describe a variety of sound sources, not only voice, from short term sound input. The proposed PCMs sound identification requires several tens(msec) of sound input, and is suitable for a mobile robot application which condition is dynamically changing. We implemented the proposed method on our mobile robot audition system equipped with a 32ch microphone array. Robot noise reduction using proposed PCMs recognition is applied to each input signal of a microphone array. The performance of daily sound recognition for separated sound sources from robot in motion is evaluated.},

abstract = {Voting-based consensus clustering refers to a distinct class of consensus methods in which the cluster label mismatch problem is explicitly addressed. The voting problem is defined as the problem of finding the optimal relabeling of a given partition with respect to a reference partition. It is commonly formulated as a weighted bipartite matching problem. In this paper, we present a more general formulation of the voting problem as a regression problem with multiple-response and multiple-input variables. We show that a recently introduced cumulative voting scheme is a special case corresponding to a linear regression method. We use a randomized ensemble generation technique, where an overproduced number of clusters is randomly selected for each ensemble partition. We apply an information theoretic algorithm for extracting the consensus clustering from the aggregated ensemble representation and for estimating the number of clusters. We apply it in conjunction with bipartite matching and cumulative voting. We present empirical evidence showing substantial improvements in clustering accuracy, stability, and estimation of the true number of clusters based on cumulative voting. The improvements are achieved in comparison to consensus algorithms based on bipartite matching, which perform very poorly with the chosen ensemble generation technique, and also to other recent consensus algorithms. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based stereo depth measurement system that is capable of handling a very large disparity range. The system performs rectification of the input video stream and a left-right consistency check to improve the accuracy of the results and generates subpixel disparities at 30 frames/second on 480 \#215; 640 images. The system is based on the Local Weighted Phase- Correlation algorithm [9] which estimates disparity using a multi-scale and multi-orientation approach. Though FPGAs are ideal devices to exploit the inherent parallelism in many computer vision algorithms, they have a finite resource capacity which poses a challenge when adapting a system to deal with large image sizes or disparity ranges. In this work, we take advantage of the temporal information available in a video sequence to design a novel architecture for the correlation unit to achieve correlation over a large range while keeping the resource utilisation very low as compared to a naive approach of designing a correlation unit in hardware.},

abstract = {This study aims to analyze the effect of government's voting power in political decision making process on stock exchange market in Turkey. Therefore, we hypothesize that the change in government's voting power in political decision making process significantly affects the composite index of Istanbul stock exchange market. To do so, we generated four distinct monthly voting power indices by using the normalized Banzhaf power index technique for the period of 1987:12-2007:7. Based on the results from multivariate OLS analyses we found that government's voting power index, voting power index of political party founding the government, and cumulative voting power index have statistically significant positive impact on the composite index of Istanbul stock exchange market whereas voting power index of main opposition party has statistically significant negative impact.},

abstract = {Continuous customer-centric requirements reprioritization is essential in successfully performing agile software development. Yet, in the agile RE literature, very little is known about how agile reprioritization happens in practice. Generic conceptual models about this process are missing, which in turn, makes it difficult for both practitioners and researchers to reason about requirements decision-making at inter-iteration time. This paper presents a Grounded Theory study on agile requirements prioritization methods to yield a conceptual model for understanding the inter-iteration prioritization process in terms of inputs and outcomes. The latter is derived by using qualitative empirical data, published earlier by other authors. Such a conceptual model makes explicit the concepts that are used tacitly in different agile requirements prioritization methods and can be used for structuring future empirical investigations about this topic.},

Our method uses a novel algorithm we call fuzzy convergence to determine the origination of the blood vessel network. We evaluate our method using 31 images of healthy retinas and 50 images of diseased retinas, containing such diverse symptoms as tortuous vessels, choroidal neovascularization, and hemorrhages that completely obscure the actual nerve. On this difficult data set, our method achieved 89\% correct detection. We also compare our method against three simpler methods, demonstrating the performance improvement. All our images and data are freely available for other researchers to use in evaluating related methods.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a directional acoustic source's position and orientation estimation approach by a microphone array network in an enclose environment. In this work we assumed that at least one array in the network yields an acceptable position estimation, and based on this assumption we try to automatically select this array and determine the source's orientation. Here, position estimates are determined indirectly using time delay of arrival (TDOA) from microphone pairs. A position candidate and energy related features (power level of the recorded signals and correlation value between pairs of recorded signals) were determined a priori for each array, and used as input of an artificial neural network (ANN) whose outputs are the orientation and the array which has the most likely source's position. Additionally, we derive weighting functions based on the ANN output and use them to combine array estimates to obtain a more reliable position estimation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel feature localization method based on a global vector concentration approach. Our approach does not rely on the detection of local salient features around feature points. Instead, we exploit global structural information of the object extracted by calculating the concentration of directional vectors from sampling points. Those vectors are combined with local pattern descriptors of a query image and selected from preliminarily trained extended templates by nearest neighbor search. Due to the insensitivity of local changes, our method can handle partially occluded and noisy objects. We apply the proposed method to fully automatic feature localization of the left ventricular in echocardiograms. The results show the effectiveness of our method in comparison with a conventional edge-based method in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous genome-wide data sources capture information on various aspects of complex biological systems. For instance, transcriptome, interactome and phenome-level information may be derived from mRNA expression data, protein-protein interaction networks, and biomedical literature corpora. Each source provides a distinct ldquoviewrdquo of the same domain, but potentially encodes different biologically-relevant patterns. Effective integration of such views can provide a richer, more informative model of an organismpsilas functional modules than that produced on a single view alone. Existing machine learning strategies for information fusion largely focus on the production of a consensus model that reflects patterns shared between views. However, the information provided by different views may not always be easily reconciled, due to the incomplete nature of the data, or the fact that some patterns will be present in one view but not in another. To address this problem, we present the Parallel Integration Clustering Algorithm (PICA), a novel cluster analysis approach which supports the simultaneous integration of information from two or more sources. The resulting model preserves patterns that are unique to individual views, as well as those common to all views. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PICA in identifying significant patterns corresponding to functional groupings, when applied to three genome-wide datasets.},
