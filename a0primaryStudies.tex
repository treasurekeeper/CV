Prioritization method name not mentioned, phrase ``100 points'' used instead.
\tabularnewline \hline

Cole 1990 \cite{Cole1990} & Cumulative voting in a municipal election: A note on voter reactions and electoral consequences &
Study published before year 2001. %rto: did you only include studies 2001--2011? Have you said that before in the paper? I might have missed that...
%kri: hmm.. see first inclusion criteria in table 3
%rto: Do you defend this somehow in the paper? Why only 2001--2011?
%kri: no
%honest answer - I did as other slrs did 
%slick answer - old studies are less relevant, outdated. Snowball sampling reveals mere relevant studies, therefore even studies before 2001 are included in snowball sampling.
