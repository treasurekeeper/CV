Reference & Title & Reason why the paper is not revealed by the search in databases  \tabularnewline
\hline\hline

\citet{Ahl2005} & An experimental comparison of five prioritization methods &
Selected databases does not contain the paper, master thesis at BTH
\tabularnewline \hline

\citet{Barney2008} & A product management challenge: Creating software product value through requirements selection & 
Prioritization method name not mentioned, phrase ``1,000 points'' used instead.
\tabularnewline \hline

\citet{Berander2004a} & Differences in views between development roles in software process improvement---A quantitative comparison &
Prioritization method name not mentioned, phrase ``100 points'' used instead.
 \tabularnewline \hline

 \citet{Berander2004} & Using students as subjects in requirements prioritization &
Unknown CV name: 100-point technique
\tabularnewline \hline

 \citet{Berander2003} & Identification of key factors in software process management: A case study &
Prioritization method name not mentioned, phrase ``100 points'' used instead.
\tabularnewline \hline

\citet{Cole1990} & Cumulative voting in a municipal election: A note on voter reactions and electoral consequences &
Study published before year 2001. %rto: did you only include studies 2001--2011? Have you said that before in the paper? I might have missed that...
%kri: hmm.. see first inclusion criteria in table 3
%rto: Do you defend this somehow in the paper? Why only 2001--2011?
%kri: no
%honest answer - I did as other slrs did 
%slick answer - old studies are less relevant, outdated. Snowball sampling reveals mere relevant studies, therefore even studies before 2001 are included in snowball sampling.
