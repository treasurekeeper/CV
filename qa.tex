7. Design, Research methods & 3 &  & 2 & Translation of perspectives from Wohlin and Aurum is arguable. First
of all, perspective \textquotedbl{}product planning 1\textquotedbl{}
is mapped to four criteria from study by Wohlin and Aurum and it received
the highest priority. At the same time perspective \textquotedbl{}risk
management\textquotedbl{} is matched only to two criteria from Wohlin
and Aurum and it has received the lowest priority.

It looks like perspective \textquotedbl{}product planning 1\textquotedbl{}
received higher priority just because it is mapped to more criteria.

Second, three out of seven perspectives are not mapped to the criteria
presented in Wohlin and Aurum. & 2 & Profiles and metamodels are compared based on the quality of products
that are built using profiles or metamodels. Such a comparison is
arguable because quality of the products can be influenced by many
other factors.\tabularnewline
