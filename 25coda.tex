\subsection{\label{coda}Compositional Data Analysis}

CV results can be seen as a special type of data---compositional data.
Compositional data does not contain absolute values. It shows only
the relative weight of a component in a whole. In \citep{Chatzipetrou2010} the authors
propose the use of compositional data analysis for the statistical analysis of CV. 

A compositional data item is a vector
($x$) of positive components with a constant sum $k$:

\begin{equation}
x=(X_{1};\, X_{2};\,...;\, X_{n})\, where\, x_{i}\geq0\, and\,\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}=k
\label{eq:compositional-data}
\end{equation}

The property of the sum of the items being restricted is called the constant
sum constraint. In CV, priorities assigned by a stakeholder to the items of a prioritization
set is a compositional data vector with a constant sum of 100.
The value of $k$ (i.e.\ 100 in this case) is arbitrary and does not affect the analysis of the data because the
information is contained in the ratios between the components of the vector.
The vector can sum up to any number but still hold the same data, i.e.\ vectors (1, 2, 7) and (10, 20, 70) are in this case considered equivalent.

The priority of an item is relative to the priority of the other items
in the set. Hence, the priority of an individual item is meaningless without
context, i.e.\ the complete set of items. The same item may receive different priority
when put in two different prioritization sets. If the item is put
in a set of items with high priority it will receive lower relative
priority. This also holds true the other way around; if the item is put in a set
with low priority items its priority will be higher.

% section about all the limitations, errors
Compositional data analysis has, however, serious limitations.
Ordinary unconstrained variables are free to take any positive or negative
values, whereas, compositional data values can only be positive and
have a constrained maximum value. Moreover, components of compositional
data vectors are not independent from each other. The fact that an
item is assigned 70 priority points means that the next item can take
only values between 0 and 30. Hence, there is a negative correlation
between the items.

Standard parametric statistical tests require that data vectors have
multivariate normal distribution. Vector $X=(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n})$
is considered to have multivariate normal distribution if any linear
combination of its parts is normally distributed. Linear combination
is defined by:
\begin{equation}
	Y=a_{1}X_{1}+a_{2}X_{2}+\ldots+aX_{n}
\end{equation}

where $Y$ is the product of lineal combination and $a_{i}$ is any
real number. Since the sum of priorities assigned in CV must add up
to 100 (or any other constant number) at least one linear combination
of $X$ is not normally distributed because it must always add up to
100:

\begin{equation}
	Y=1\cdot X_{1}+1\cdot X_{2}+\ldots+1\cdot X_{n}=100
\end{equation}

In our opinion, the above shows that CV results do not follow a multivariate normal distribution and, hence, means that they must not be analysed using parametric statistical tests \citep{Pawlowsky-Glahn2006}.


\subsubsection{\label{Problem-of-Zeroes}Problem of Zeroes}

Compositional data analysis requires that ratios between any components in a vector can be
computed. Computing a ratio with a zero value is meaningless. This causes
a problem because CV allows stakeholders to assign zero priorities
to some prioritization items. There are two types of zeroes in compositional
data: essential and rounded.

Essential zeroes mean that a data component
is not present. Rounded zeroes mean that the component is present but
its value is very low. We can assume that zeroes in CV results are
rounded because the priority of an item is a completely abstract notion
and the instrument for measuring priority is human judgement \citep{Chatzipetrou2010}.

Before compositional data analysis can be applied to CV results, we must first remove
zeroes in the data. One approach can be to forbid stakeholders
to assign zero priorities. This approach is used in e.g.\ \citep{Pettersson2008}.
But this can add some unnecessary complexity to the prioritization
process. In \citep{Chatzipetrou2010} the authors propose the use of a multiplicative replacement
strategy (as defined in \citep{Martin-Fernandez2003}) for CV result analysis.

This method replaces rounded zeroes with small values using the expression

\begin{equation}
r_{j}=\begin{cases}
\delta_{j}, & if\, x_{j}=0,\\
(1-\frac{\sum_{k\mid x_{k}=0}\delta_{k}}{c})x_{j}, & if\, x_{j}>0,\end{cases}\label{eq:zero-replace}
\end{equation}

where $\delta_{j}$ is the imputed value and $c$ is the constant sum constraint (the same as $k$ in equation (\ref{eq:compositional-data})).
In order for the total sum of components to stay constant the equation subtracts some value from
the items with a priority higher than zero.
More is subtracted from components with higher values than from the components with lower values and the value of the imputed $\delta_{j}$ is arbitrary.

\subsubsection{\label{Isometric-Logratio-Transformation}Isometric Log-Ratio Transformation}

In order to be able to apply standard statistical methods to compositional data it must be transformed to remove the inherent correlation of the values.
Compositional data analysis proposes special transformations that change the compositional data values to unconstrained real values.
One such transformation is isometric log-ratio ($ilr$) transformation (as proposed by \citep{Pawlowsky-Glahn2006,Filzmoser2007a}):

\begin{eqnarray}
z & = & \left(z_{1},\,\ldots,\, z_{D-1}\right),\nonumber \\
z_{i} & = & \sqrt{\frac{i}{i+1}}log\frac{\sqrt[i]{\prod_{j=1}^{i}x_{j}}}{x_{i+1}}for\, i=1,\ldots,D-1\label{eq:ilr}
\end{eqnarray}

where $x$ is the vector that is being transformed and $z$ is the vector that is created. It should be noted that $z$ is shorter than $x$ by one element.

After compositional data vectors are transformed using zero replacement and $ilr$, any standard statistical tests can be applied.
