% need for prioritization
Software products are becoming larger and more complex. Each product
is usually affected by a large number of factors such as functional
requirements, quality attributes, or software process improvement
issues. Since time, funding, and resources are limited, it is seldom
possible or even desirable to fully address all the factors. Therefore,
the level of attention to a particular factor must be decided according
to its importance (e.g.\ business value), cost, risk, volatility, 
dependencies between the factors and other such criteria. 
These type of decisions are made by product stakeholders:
users, clients, managers, sponsors, developers, and other persons
associated with the product. In order to make decisions regarding a
large number of factors it is highly advisable to prioritize the factors
in a systematic way \cite{Berander2005}.

% pros of CV
One of the prioritization methods used in software engineering is Cumulative Voting (CV) \cite{Leffingwell1999}.
The main advantage of CV is that it is relatively simple and fast, yet produces priorities in ratio scale \cite{Berander2005,Ahl2005}.
This allows us to not only determine what prioritization items are more important but also how much more important they are.
(Ratio scale prioritization is particularly important in software release planning and cost-value analysis \cite{Berander2006a, Karlsson1997}.)

% importance of the analysis
Prioritization is usually performed by multiple stakeholders where individual priorities are combined into a single priority list.
Each stakeholder's preferences may have different weight in the final priority.
Such prioritization provides more information than just the priorities of factors.
In the end, it may be useful to analyze the results of the prioritization to assess disagreement between stakeholders, measure stakeholder satisfaction with the results or find distinct groups of stakeholders.

% purpose, problem
The purpose of this study is to help industry practitioners and academia researchers in adopting, using and developing CV, while the importance of prioritization in software engineering and the prospectiveness of CV constitutes a need to do further research in this area.

% methods
This study presents a systematic literature review on the empirical use of CV and CV result analysis methods.
A new method for CV result analysis, called Equality of Cumulative Votes (ECV), is proposed.
The method identifies prioritization items with \emph{equal} priority.
ECV is evaluated using a considerable amount of data, which was obtained from the primary studies identified by the systematic review (through the kindness of the authors of said studies).
