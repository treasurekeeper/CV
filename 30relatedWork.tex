\section{Related Work\label{relatedwork}}
In the previous sections we introduced requirements prioritization methods, some examples of CV result analysis methods and a more detailed description of compositional data analysis and CV.

In this section we only present systematic literature reviews perfomed in this field and how they relate to our study.

A systematic review of requirements prioritization methods is presented in \cite{Khan2006}. The study focuses on prioritization method comparison and selects eight relevant studies. Two of the studies use CV. These two studies are also included in the systematic literature review conducted as part of this study. In \cite{Khan2006} the author concludes that there is little research on requirements prioritization and studies usually deal with a small number of requirements.

In the next section we will cover the methodology of this study. As will be presented later, the systematic literature review had two purposes: to assemble data that have been used in CV and to investigate if there existed a method of analysis that would identify prioritization items with equal priority.
