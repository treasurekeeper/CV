A systematic review of requirements prioritization methods is presented in \citep{Khan2006}. The study focuses on prioritization method comparison and selects eight relevant studies. Two of the studies use CV. These studies are also revealed by the systematic literature review conducted as part of this study. \citet{Khan2006} concludes that there is little research on requirements prioritization and studies usually deal with a small number of requirements.

The systematic literature review presented in this paper does not reveal any CV result analysis methods that allows to identify prioritization items with equal priority. Thus, this problem is not addressed in any way.
